# Fortnite db
A Fortnite database app, for checking weapons and items.

## Installation and Setup

Download/Clone this repo to your local machine. Navigate to the root folders and install the dependencies.

cd backend-graphql `npm install`

cd backend-rest `npm install`

cd frontend-javascript `npm install`

### Running the App

There are four servers, two for backend and two for the frontend. You only need the REST and GraphQL server, for the backend to work. And either the Javascript, or React frontend server as they are the same.

The only difference between the frontend versions, is the framework. One built in Vanilla JS, and the other in React. All the servers are running on different ports, so you can see the App in Vanilla JS and React at the same time if you want to.
